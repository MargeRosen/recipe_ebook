WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
or
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l logfile start
